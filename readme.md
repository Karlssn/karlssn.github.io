# Start Page

As I wanted a more customisable new tab/ start page I designed this page. To make this page work properly I used github pages to host the website and this [extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) for rebinding the default new tab.


## To Do
* Finnish the design
    * Create logos for main sites
* Features
    * Implement notes (possible Google Keep)
